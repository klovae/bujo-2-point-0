#About BuJo 2.0

BuJo 2.0 is a Sinatra application created by Elyse Klova to fulfill the requirements of Learn.co's Sinatra Portfolio Project. All functionality was built using Ruby, ActiveRecord, and Sinatra, with a special shoutout to ERB for making a lot of nice things possible.

The application itself is designed to follow the standard conventions of bullet journaling, especially as it pertains to creating and working with daily task lists. BuJo 2.0 lets you create, edit, and delete both tasks and events. You can also migrate incomplete tasks forward to the current day.

For more information about the bullet journal methodology, the best source is the original BulletJournal.com.
